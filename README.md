Join us for "CodeQuest" â€“ a friendly, small-group event where you can tackle algorithmic challenges in a welcoming and collaborative atmosphere. 
Whether you're a junior or an experienced developer, this is your chance to sharpen your skills, connect with fellow enthusiasts, and have a great time.
